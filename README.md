### My Graphs

I started by converting the `census.csv` file into JSON.

I kept things simple, and didn't use any sort of generator or build tools. To view the charts, you'll just need to open the `index.html` file in the browser. The charts are built using the Charts.js library, which I'm loading via CDN.
